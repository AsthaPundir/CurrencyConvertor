This Android app allows the user to convert an input amount (entered in an EditText) from one currency to another using a fixed conversion rate (0.80). It uses ViewBinding to easily interact with the UI components, such as a Button for initiating the conversion and a TextView for displaying the result. When the user clicks the convertButton, the convertCurrency() method retrieves the input, performs the conversion, and displays the result in the TextView. The app also logs method entries and exits for debugging purposes. The conversion result is formatted using a string resource.
